School Management System App Code.
This Repository will be used for our Database Project. We chose School Management because it's a field with a lot of entities. This is a pulic repository because we want to share our code with others for their learning and proffesional use. For this Project, we are working on the four basic operations in databases which are Insert, Display, Edit and Delete. Our goal is to dynamically display data, edit and delete it.
